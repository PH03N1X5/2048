\subsubsection{Main Board}
For the main board, an Arduino mega2560 was used. The Arduino Mega 2560 is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560. It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button \cite{arduino_2023_mega}.

\subsubsection{Input}
For the input, an \textbf{MPU6050} was used. 
The \textbf{MPU6050} devices combine a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer on the same silicon die, together with an onboard Digital Motion Processor™ (DMP™), which processes complex 6-axis MotionFusion algorithms. The device can access external magnetometers or other sensors through an auxiliary master \ItwoC bus, allowing the devices to gather a full set of sensor data without intervention from the system processor.

\subsubsection{Display}
For the display, an \textbf{WS2812B} NeoPixel 8x8 Led Strip was used. Even if it is called a LED Strip, it is actually a matrix, but in the code is is still 
refered as an array.

\subsection{Connections}
\newcommand{\colorsymbol}{\textbf{\$}}
\newcommand{\GND}{\textcolor{black}{\colorsymbol}\textbf{GND }}
\newcommand{\VCC}{\textcolor{red}{\colorsymbol}\textbf{VCC }}
\newcommand{\SCL}{\textcolor{violet}{\colorsymbol}\textbf{SCL }}
\newcommand{\SDA}{\textcolor{green}{\colorsymbol}\textbf{SDA }}
\newcommand{\DIN}{\textcolor{gray}{\colorsymbol}\textbf{DIN }}
This symbol "\colorsymbol" will be used to indicate what color the pin has on the diagram so it's easier to follow along. 

The common ports that both components use are \VCC and \GND. 
These connect to the dedicated \VCC and \GND ports on the board.

Out of the 8 ports the \textit{input} has, only 4 are of intereset to us: \VCC, \GND, \SCL and \SDA.  \\
\SCL (\textbf{clock}) is connected to digital port \textbf{21 (SCL)} \\
\SDA (\textbf{data}) is connected to digital port \textbf{20 (SDA)} \\
These are the ports of the \textbf{MPU6050} which communicate with the main board using the 
\ItwoC protocol.  \\ 

The \textit{display} has 3 ports: \VCC, \GND and \DIN. \\
\DIN is connected to digital port \textbf{32}, but it is configurable.\\
This is the port that controls the display, and where the data is sent.
